This project aims at designing a predictor that helps the organisation to estimate the value of customer churn i.e the number of paying customers who became repeated custmers.

Data cleaning is the first process that needs to be done in order to work with the dataset. After that with the help of the scikit learn library I have pre-processed data and following that I have split the data into training and testing dataset.

Further I have designed a neural network by specifying the hidden layers, activation function, opitmizer, loss function etc. with the aim of calculating the accuracy of the model before it can be used to make the predictions.

Images below showcase the confusion matrix that has been created by using two different optimizers. With this data in hand useful insights about the data can be gained by calculating
F score
Precision
Recall
